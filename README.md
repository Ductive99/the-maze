# The Maze

## Description
The Maze Game is a simple yet engaging project that allows users to navigate through a maze using arrow keys. The goal is to reach the end of the maze while avoiding obstacles and finding the shortest path. This project serves as a demonstration of maze generation algorithms, pathfinding techniques, and real-time rendering using JavaScript and the p5.js library.

## Features
- Player movement controlled by arrow keys.
- Real-time rendering of the maze and player using p5.js.
- Collision detection to prevent the player from moving through walls.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ductive99/the-maze.git
    ```
2. Open the `MVP/index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.

## Usage
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate through the maze.
- Avoid walls and obstacles while finding the shortest path to the exit.
- Enjoy exploring different maze configurations generated randomly.
